# Triangular Arbitrage Runner

The `run_triangular_arbitrage.py` script monitors real-time order books and evaluates triangular routes that it discovers automatically from the exchange markets. By default it only reports opportunities and does **not** attempt to place any orders.

At the top of the script you will find a handful of boolean defaults (for example `ENABLE_EXECUTION_DEFAULT`, `LIVE_TRADING_DEFAULT`, and `USE_TESTNET_DEFAULT`) along with `EXCHANGE_DEFAULT`. New helpers such as `STARTING_CURRENCY_DEFAULT`, `MAX_ROUTE_LENGTH_DEFAULT`, `EVALUATION_INTERVAL_DEFAULT`, and `TRADE_LOG_PATH_DEFAULT` make it easy to pin the seed currency to USD, control the longest route to evaluate, choose how infrequently the periodic safety check should run, and decide where executed legs should be logged. Toggle these values to quickly change the runner's behaviour without modifying your command line each time. CLI arguments still override the inline defaults when explicitly supplied.

## Usage

```
python -m cryptopy.scripts.trading.run_triangular_arbitrage \
  --starting-currency USD \
  --starting-amount 100 \
  --min-profit-percentage 0.2
```

Key options:

- `--starting-currency` restricts discovery to routes that both begin and end in the chosen currency (USD by default).
- `--enable-execution` toggles order placement. Omit the flag to keep execution disabled and simply review the logs.
- `--live-trading` switches from simulated test orders to real exchange orders. It requires `--enable-execution`.
- `--use-testnet` enables the sandbox/testnet for exchanges that provide one.
- `--trade-log` stores each simulated or live leg in a CSV file for auditing (defaults to the `TRADE_LOG_PATH_DEFAULT` location if left unspecified).
- `--config` can point at a YAML file (defaults to `config.yaml` in the project root) that contains credentials. For Kraken, the loader expects an entry in the form:

  ```yaml
  kraken_websocket:
    api_key: YOUR_KEY
    api_secret: YOUR_SECRET
  ```

## Automatic route discovery

When the runner starts it queries the exchange metadata to build every distinct three-leg triangular route that begins with the configured starting currency (USD by default). It then primes each order book and filters the routes using the arbitrage-friendly condition:

\[
\ln(p_1 f_1) + \ln(p_2 f_2) + \ln(p_3 f_3) < 0,
\]

where `p` is the effective conversion price for a leg (buy uses the best ask while sell uses the inverse of the best bid) and `f` reflects the taker fee. Routes that satisfy this negative log-sum constraint are passed to the simulator for a full depth-aware evaluation, ensuring that only promising opportunities are explored without requiring manual route definitions.

## Sandbox and exchange support

Some ccxt exchanges expose official sandbox or testnet environments that can be toggled through `set_sandbox_mode(True)`. Examples include **Binance** (spot and futures testnet), **BitMEX**, **KuCoin**, and **OKX**. These are ideal for rehearsing end-to-end order placement without risking fundsâ€”set `USE_TESTNET_DEFAULT = True` or pass `--use-testnet` on the CLI to request the sandbox where it is available.

Kraken operates a **Spot Trading Sandbox** at <https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022839011-Kraken-Spot-Trading-API-Sandbox>, but the ccxt library does not currently expose that sandbox through `set_sandbox_mode`. When you connect to Kraken through this toolkit, ccxt reports that sandbox mode is unsupported and requests fall back to the production API. If you require a sandbox-backed workflow, consider testing with one of the exchanges above. For Kraken, plan to validate with small real-money trades once you are satisfied that the strategy behaves correctly.
Each evaluation cycle logs the trigger that woke it (market data refresh, periodic fallback, or a post-trade confirmation), the start time, and how long it took to review the available routes. The log message also reports how many of the discovered routes currently have complete order-book data and how many of those satisfy the negative log-sum filter, making it clear why a subset of routes advance to the deeper profitability simulation. This makes it easy to confirm that the runner only reacts when something meaningful happens while still providing an infrequent periodic backstop.

If an exchange's websocket feed becomes unavailable or does not expose order-book streaming, the watcher automatically falls back to REST polling so market data updates continue to trigger evaluations (albeit at the configured polling cadence).
